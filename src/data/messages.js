        message: `Happy birthday Prime! Canâ€™t believe I kept this domain from your last birthday and renewed it for another year. But here we are, right? Haha. I think I've outdone myself this year though.

I made you a game. Itâ€™ll probably remind you of some other game. I promise it was made with all the love and care and ooey goeey but I donâ€™t promise it to be bug free. I built it in a week-ish so like any good dev, my estimations were off and planning was poor and there was way more to it than I thought. Feature creep was at the utmost max. The product manager (me) was on my case the entire time about getting it done well in time for the big day. Despite everything though, I had a ton of fun making this.

Anyways, I hope you have a good birthday with your family and friends. Youâ€™ll always have my support in whatever you do.

Two years ago, I tuned into your stream after seeing a post about addiction on Twitter. Before then, I knew you as the Vim guy on YouTube. I wasn't sure what to expect. But tuning in for the first time to find you sticking something in your earholes while all of chat was freaking out had me sold :P

At the time, life was a mess, and I was not in a great place, which led to me dealing with severe mania and psychosis. I spammed nonsense in chat, got banned, and honestly, I deserved it. But six months later, after being hospitalized, diagnosed with bipolar disorder and recovering from my episode, I was let back in. Getting unbanned probably felt small on your end, but for me it was huge. 

I love that you are open and candid about your own struggles. It made me feel less alone and seen in a world where people keep such things to themselves in fear of being judged. You don't sugarcoat, and you give it to us raw which is so damn refreshing to experience. No shit sandwiches served! Over time, I became part of your community. I made an incredible set of friends who I learn from every day while sharing laughs, KEKWs, and KEKWaits

Your streams have become my escape after long days at the office. The unhinged humor, your relentlessness, and unexpected tangents were exactly what I needed after corpo life sucked the passion and fun out of me. I've learned about your journey, not just as a coder or streamer, but as a person. I'm in awe of you.

You inspired me to start streaming myself, I've been really enjoying it and am glad to be doing something outside of work that feels fulfilling. I should've started sooner! That spark you carry and the enthusiasm you exude is hella contagious man. You're proof that hard work, consistency, and embracing the chaos makes life worth living. And even now, as you take a break to care for your voice and your family, I admire your decision. It shows strength, not weakness. You're antifragile AF and will come back stronger than ever.

Meeting you at TwitchCon and having that 1-on-1 was surreal. I'm very grateful for being invited to come on stream while I was there. It made my TwitchCon experience so much more awesome! Also, it has been scientifically proven that you give the best hugs. This is true and factual.

So, happy birthday Prime, you avocado toast eatin millennial!

I appreciate you so much. You've impacted my life more than you know.

Anyway,
But why male models?`

I used to think tech was a strictly secular world, and I felt lonely in my faith,Â and I almost dropped out of my CS program because of it. But then I started watching you, and you often share about your faith openly, and it encouraged me to stay. Now I am blessed with a relatively good job and have been enjoying this journey (while meeting many fellow Christians too!). Once again, thank you, and Jesus bless you."
